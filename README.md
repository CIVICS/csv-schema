CSV Schema
==========

A Schema Language for CSV (Comma Separated Value) files.

This repository holds the code for creating the CSV Schema specification document, which
is then published as HTML. The Schema language is formally expressed in EBNF.

You can find the the documentation and latest published specification here:

Repository Organisation
-----------------------
* `master` branch holds the source code for producing the specification.

* `gh-pages` holds the documentation and copies of each published version of the specification.

* There is one tag from master each time a version of the specification is published. The tag name reflects
the specification version number.
